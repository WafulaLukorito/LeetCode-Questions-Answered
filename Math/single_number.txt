"""
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

2*(a+b+c) - (a+a+b+b+c) = c

(a+b+c) => summation of unique elements
(a+a+b+b+c) => current sum

#? Time complexity: O(2*N) = O(N): We pass over input array once, then pass separately oer the set

#? Space complexity: Constant, due to usage of a set.
