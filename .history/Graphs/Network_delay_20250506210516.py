    LeetCode #743
    https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/
    
    There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N. Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), 
    where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w  is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target. 
    Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal?
    If it is impossible, return -1.
    
    Example 1:
    Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
    Output: 2
